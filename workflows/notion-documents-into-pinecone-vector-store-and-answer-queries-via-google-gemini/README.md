# Notion Document Vectorizer

Professional, production-ready n8n workflow to sync Notion documents into a Pinecone vector store and answer queries via a Google Gemini (PaLM) powered assistant.

## Overview

- **Purpose:** Ingest and embed Notion documents into a Pinecone vector database (dimension 768) and provide an n8n-based chat interface that retrieves relevant documents and responds using Google Gemini.
- **Primary components:** n8n workflow nodes for chat trigger, AI agent, Google Gemini (chat + embeddings), Redis memory, and Pinecone vector store.

## Suggested Project Name

- **Name:** `Notion Document Vectorizer`

## Features

- Real-time chat trigger handling
- Contextual memory via Redis
- Embeddings generated by Google Gemini
- Vector retrieval from Pinecone with a `doc-lib` namespace
- Modular n8n workflow for easy customization

## Files Changed

- Workflow (secrets redacted): [workflow.json](workflow.json#L1-L400)
- This README: [README.md](README.md#L1-L200)

## Credentials & Placeholders

Sensitive values have been removed from the workflow and replaced with placeholders. Replace these placeholders in your local copy or configure them in n8n's credential manager (recommended) — do NOT commit secrets to Git.

Placeholders used in `workflow.json`:

- `<<GOOGLE_PALM_CREDENTIAL_ID>>` — Google Gemini (PaLM) credential ID used by the Chat and Embeddings nodes.
- `<<REDIS_CREDENTIAL_ID>>` — Redis credential ID for `Redis Chat Memory`.
- `<<PINECONE_CREDENTIAL_ID>>` — Pinecone API credential ID for vector storage.
- `<<WEBHOOK_ID>>` — Webhook identifier used by the chat trigger node.
- `<<INSTANCE_ID>>` — Workflow instance identifier placeholder.

## Recommended Local Setup

1. Install and run n8n (docker or locally). See n8n docs: https://docs.n8n.io
2. Import the workflow JSON into your n8n instance (use the editor's import feature).
3. Create credentials inside n8n for:
   - Google Gemini / PaLM API
   - Redis
   - Pinecone
4. Update the imported workflow's credential references via the n8n editor (select the corresponding credential entries). Alternatively, replace the placeholder values with the correct credential IDs only on your local copy (do not commit).

## Security Best Practices

- Store all API keys/IDs in n8n's credential manager or environment variables.
- Do not commit any secrets to version control.
- Rotate credentials regularly and revoke unused keys.

## How to Contribute

- Open issues for feature requests or bugs.
- Propose changes via pull requests; keep secrets out of PRs and CI logs.
